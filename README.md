## MATLAB_and_FORTRAN

This is a FORTRAN program which estimates the derivative of a function based on its known value a discrete points. The technique that helps utilizes this program is called the central difference. MATLAB was used to gather the data from the FORTRAN created text file and imported over to MATLAB for plotting. All images and data were extracted from MATLAB and transferred over to a notepad editor. The report was then contructed using codeblocks where "pdflatex" command was used to format it from the notepad editor.

## Getting Started

If you wish to try the programs out yourself, then first; download code blocks to your computer. Go to your system setting and add the 'PATH' directory from codeblocks.
